The "Check Weather" App keeps you informed the current temperature, sunrise and sunset timings, humidity, pressure and wind of your favorite cities. It also shows the current local time of your favorite cities worldwide.
Thanks to the free weather API from “openweathermap.org”, Retrofit retrieves the JSON data and is parsed using GSON and the current weather data is made available to the users.
